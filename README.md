Weather App

Here, I have demonstrated how to build weather application that performs two task. 
First, this app will show Real time weather of your Current location & Second, it will shows the Weather conditions of a particular city when you search the particular city.



While making this app you will learn all the basics in React.js such as Hooks, States, Props, Components, effects, API Call, Dynamic data display, Dynamic fetch data, Working with forms, & many more.


#Packages used:

1. react-animated-weather
2. react-live-clock
3. axios



#API Key used:
To get weather data we need to use API to fetch data & for that i have used Open Weather Map API.
